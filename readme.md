# Editorconfig

This repository contains the `.editorconfig` file that will be used for all of 
the OwlDomain projects.

## Generation

The final `.editorconfig` file is generated by concatenating all of the `*.editorconfig`
files found in the `parts` directory, they are sorted alphabetically before concatenating.

The only exception is that the `parts/root.editorconfig` and `parts/common.editorconfig` will
always be concatenated first.
