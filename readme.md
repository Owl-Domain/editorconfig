This repository contains the [.editorconfig](/.editorconfig) file that will be used for all of
the OwlDomain projects.


## Development

Currently this repository is being developed on the `develop` branch, changes will be
merged to `main` *(the default branch)* whenever there is an update.


## Generation

The final [.editorconfig](/.editorconfig) file is generated by concatenating all of the `*.editorconfig`
files found in the [parts](/parts/) directory, they are sorted alphabetically before concatenating.

The only exception is that the [parts/root.editorconfig](/parts/root.editorconfig) and
[parts/common.editorconfig](/parts/common.editorconfig) files will always be concatenated first.
